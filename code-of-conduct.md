All participants in DBA Slack are required to comply with the following code of conduct. Administrators (see below for definition of administrators) will enforce this code throughout the service ("Team").

# The Short Version

Be respectful of other people; respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered; and if you can’t resolve an issue contact the administrators. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you may be asked to leave the Team.

# The Long Version

## Respect

The DBA Slack is an intentionally positive community that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of independent members and the diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to our community.

The DBA Slack is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender or gender identity (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or career path.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Respectful behavior includes:

* Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* If you’re not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the administrators. We’d rather hear from you than hear about something you said or did after the fact, and we are here to help.
* Don’t be a bystander. Role model respectful behaviour, but also help to address disrespect when you see it.

## When something happens
1. Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s).
2. That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue.
3. If this doesn’t happen, or if you’re uncomfortable speaking up, contact admins.
4. As soon as available, an admin will join, identify themselves, and take further action (see consequnces actions below).

When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances, including when simulated online. The only exception to sexual topics is channels/spaces specifically for topics of sexual identity.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Casual mention of slavery or indentured servitude and/or false comparisons of one’s occupation or situation to slavery. Please consider using or asking about alternate terminology when referring to such metaphors in technology.
* Making light of/making mocking comments about trigger warnings and content warnings.
* Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of “outing” of any aspect of someone’s identity without their consent.
* Publishing screenshots or quotes, especially from identity channels, without all quoted users’ explicit consent.
* Publishing or telling others that a member belongs to a particular identity channel without asking their consent first.
* Publishing of non-harassing private communication.
* Any of the above even when presented as “ironic” or “joking”.
* Any attempt to present “reverse-ism” versions of the above as violations. Examples of reverse-isms are “reverse racism”, “reverse sexism”, “heterophobia”, and “cisphobia”.
* Unsolicited explanations under the assumption that someone doesn’t already know it. Ask before you teach! Don’t assume what people’s knowledge gaps are.
* Feigning or exaggerating surprise when someone admits to not knowing something.
* “Well-actuallies”
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

Who watches the watchers?
Admins and other leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the community’s leadership. These may include anything from removal from the admin team to a permanent ban from the community.


## Apologize for Mistakes

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, listen intently, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them and that you avoid repeating them in the future.

## Consequences

If the administrators determine that a human is behaving disrespectfully, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate within this Slack team, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the Team.

As administrators, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can’t foresee every situation, and thus if in the administrator's judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.

## Profile

We ask that all members identify themselves in their Slack profile with:

- First name
- Last name
- Role or Title
- Company name
- A non-default avatar

examples:
- Jane Doe, DBA @ PastaRosa
- John Doe, Infrastructure Engineer @ MoccaChino
- Jess Doe, Database team manager @ OliveOil

Please consult the administrators if there is a reason to anonymize any of the profile details.
